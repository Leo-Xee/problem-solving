# problem-solving

This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic and data structure problems from Baekjoon Online Judge and LeetCode, implemented in C++ and JavaScript.

## Strategy

1. **Read the problem statement carefully**, check the constraints, and plan your approach before coding.
2. **Set a time limit (30 minutes to 1 hour).** If you can't solve it within that time, study the solution and understand the key concepts.
3. **Analyze the time complexity of your solution before submitting.** Check if it meets the problem's constraints and optimize if needed.
4. **Analyze other solutions after solving the problem.** Study different approaches and clean, efficient code.
5. **Reattempt the problem within a month.** Keep practicing until you can solve it within 15 minutes.
